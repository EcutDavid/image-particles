[Online Demo](https://github.com/EcutDavid/image-particles)
This effect is mainly made with [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/), a nice WebGL library!

NOTE:
There are some dev-dependencies and configuration for babel compilers & eslint stuff remains in codebase, not being used, will clean them later.
